# Troubleshooting

Please take advantage of the many Board X resources available to you through 96Boards, MediaTek, and Coursera

- [96Boards Board X Forum]()
   - The DragonBoard has its very own 96Boards forum. If you can't find a pre-existing thread that addresses your issue, start your own and let the community help out!
- [Board X Forum]()
   - Similar to the 96Boards forum; however, this page will have threads for all MediaTek products
- [Board X]()
   - Buy the Board X here!
- [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/internet-of-things)
   - Board X uses the same specification! Students from the [University of California San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/) put together an "Internet of Things" (IoT) course focused around the DragonBoard 410c (again, same specification as Board X!). It is free to audit, or you can purchase the specialization package for a cool certificate!
- [Report a bug!](../../../Report_a_bug.md)
   - Instructions on how to report bugs for any of our 96Boards hardware and software, this includes the Board X!
- [Board Recovery](../installation/board-recovery.md)
   - Bricked board? Many software issues can be fixed with a simple "board recovery"
