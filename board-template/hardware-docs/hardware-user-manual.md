< A short section describing the properties of GPS chip, what additional features are supported >

The GPS implementation is based on MTK connectivity chip MT6631 (U5003) supporting GPS, Galileo, Glonass and Beidou. It can receive GPS, Galileo, Beidou / Glonass simultaneously for more accurate positioning. But there is no GPS antenna on the board. You need to connect an external antenna to the RF connector CON5006.

## Display Interface

< A short section describing the how the board satisfies this requirement and if there are limitations when a mezzanine display board is connected. It is highly recommended to provide a block diagram showing how the SoC, external connectors and intermediate drivers/convertors are wired up >

### HDMI

- The 96Boards specification calls for an HDMI port to be present on the board. The MT6797 doesn’t include a built-in HDMI interface.
- The Helio X20 Development Board deploys the built-in DPI interface as the source for the HDMI output. A peripheral Bridge IC (U6502, MT8193) performs this task and it supports a resolution from 480i to 1080p at 30Hz.

### MIPI-DSI

- The 96Boards specification calls for a MIPI-DSI implementation via the High Speed Expansion Connector.
- The Helio X20 Development Board implements a 4-lane MIPI_DSI interface meeting this requirement. It can support up to FHD(1080p@60fps). The Helio X20 Development Board routes the MIPI_DSI interface signals to the DSI-0 interface of the MT6797.

### Camera Interface

< A short section describing if the board satisfies this requirement and how. It is highly recommended to provide a block diagram showing how the SoC, external connectors and intermediate drivers/convertors are wired up >

- The 96Boards specification calls for two camera interfaces.
- The Helio X20 Development Board supports two camera interfaces, one with a 4-lane MIPI_CSI interface and one with 2-lane MIPI_CSI interface, meeting this requirement. The 4-lane MIPI_CSI interface can support 25M camera and the 2-lane MIPI_CSI interface can support 8M camera.

### USB Ports

< A short section describing the how the board satisfies these requirements, the type of ports available and if there are limitations e.g. host and slave ports can’t be used simultaneously >

The Helio X20 Development Board supports a USB device port and three USB host ports via a USB MUX(U6503). The input channel( D+/D-) of USB MUX is connected to the P0 port of the SOC MT6797, and the two output channels(1D+/1D-,2D+/2D-) are connected to micro USB port and USB hub respectively. The three USB host ports are connected to the downstream ports of the USB hub.The control of U6503 is done via a software controlled GPIO (USB_SW_SEL, EINT9 from the SOC MT6797). When this signal is logic low, ‘0’, the USB data lines are routed to the Micro USB connector and the MT6797 P0 port is set to device mode. When ‘USB_SW_SEL’ is logic level high, ‘1’, the USB data lines are routed to U6401 (a 3-port USB HUB) and the MT6797 P0 port is set to host mode. The user can overwrite the software control by sliding switch 3 of dip-switch SW3205 to the ‘ON’ position. That action forces the USB–MUX (U6503) to route the USB data lines to the USB HUB. The overwrite option exists for the host mode only, you cannot hardware overwrite the MUX to force device mode.

### USB Host ports

< Example >

The Helio X20 Development Board supports three USB host port via a USB2.0 hub (U6401 USB2513-AEZG). Its upstream signal is connected to USB_P0 interface of MT6797.

- Port 1 of the USB HUB is routed to CON6401, a Type ‘A’ USB Host connector. A current limited controller (U6402) sets the Power Current limit to 1.18A.  
- Port 2 of the USB HUB is routed to CON6402, a Type ‘A’ USB Host connector. A current limited controller (U6403) sets the Power Current limit to 1.18A.
- Port 3 of the USB HUB is routed to the High Speed Expansion connector. No current limited controller is implemented on the board for this channel.

### USB Device ports

< Example >

The Helio X20 Development Board implements a device port. The port is located at CON6403, a Micro USB type B. It is routed to USB_P0 interface of MT6797.

> Note: the board can work in one mode at a time, Host mode or Device mode, not both.

### Audio

< A short section describing the how the board satisfies these requirements and any additional functionality exposed >

|:----------|:--------|:---------------------------------------------------|
|    R916   |  DC_IN  |  To measure the current of total base board power  |
|    R923   |  SYS_5V |  To measure the current of SYS_5V power            |
|    R924   |  VBAT   |  To measure the current of VBAT power              |

### External Fan Connection

< A short section describing the how the board satisfies these requirements >

The 96Boards specification calls for support for an external fan. That can be achieved by using the 5V or the SYS_DCIN (12V), both present on the Low Speed Expansion connector.

### UART

< A short section describing the how the board satisfies these requirements and if the UART is routed to a onboard header as well, steps to enable the functionality >

The Helio X20 Development Board has two UART ports (UART1 / UART0), both present on the Low Speed Expansion connector. They are routed to the UART1 (UART1_TxD, UART1_RxD) and UART0 (UART0_TxD, UART0_RxD, UART0_CTS, UART0_RTS) interface of MT6797 separately. The UART1 is used for the serial console output.

### Buttons

< A short section describing the how the board satisfies these requirements, possible configuration of button behaviour through a switch or jumper >

The Helio X20 Development Board presents four buttons. They are Power key,VOL up key,VOL down key and Reset key. The power ON/OFF and RESET signals are also routed to the Low Speed Expansion connector.

#### Power Button

< Example >

The push-button SW3201 serves as the power-on/sleep button. Upon applying power to the board, press the power button for more than 3 seconds, the board will boot up. Once the board is running you can turn power-off by pressing the power button for more than 3 seconds. If the board is in a sleep mode, pressing the power bottom will wake up the board. Oppositely, if the board is in an active mode, pressing the power bottom will change the board into sleep mode.

#### Reset Button

< Example >

The push-button SW3204 serves as the hardware reset button. press the button for more than 1 seconds,the system will be rebooted.

#### Volume up

< Example >

The Volume UP button is used to control the output speaker volume of the Helio X20 Development Board.

#### Volume down

< Example >

The Volume Down button is used to control the output speaker volume of the Helio X20 Development Board.

### LED Indicators

< A short section describing the how the board satisfies these requirements,  what the use-configurable LEDs are configured to do, how to change them >

The Helio X20 Development Board has six LEDs.

#### Two activity LEDs

< Example >

- WiFi activity LED –The Helio X20 Development Board drives this Yellow LED via BPI_BUS12, an IO from MT6797.
- BT activity LED –The Helio X20 Development Board drives this Blue LED via BPI_BUS13, an IO from MT6797.

#### Four User LEDs

< Example >

The four user LEDs are surface mount Green in 0603 size located next to the micro USB connector. The Helio X20 Development Board drives the four LEDs from the MT6797 GPIO: BPI_BUS8, BPI_BUS9，BPI_BUS10 and BPI_BUS11.

### Additional Functionality

< Use this section to describe any additional functionality you’ve added to the board besides what is mandated in the 96boards spec, each in their own sub-section e.g. JTAG, GPS, Mic, SATA, PCIe, additional expansion connectors >

The Helio X20 Development Board also has a additional interface (CON9001)for user debugging. It includes JTAG , UART0 and UART1 interface. The position is reserved, but the component is not mounted in the mass production. The component of CON9001 is AXT640124 produced by Panasonic. This interface should be used with the MTK debug board.

### SPI 0

< Example >

- The 96Boards specification calls for one SPI bus master to be provided on the Low Speed Expansion Connector.
- The Helio X20 Development Board implements a full SPI master with 4 wires, CLK, CS, MOSI and MISO. The signals are connected directly to the MT6797 SoC and driven at 1.8V.

### Power and Reset

< Example >

- The 96Boards specification calls for a signal on the Low Speed Expansion Connector that can power on/off the board and a signal that serves as a board reset signal.
- The Helio X20 Development Board routes the PWR_BTN_N (named PWRKEY on schematic) signal to the PWRKEY pin of the PMIC MT6351. This signal is driven by SW3201 as well, the on-board power on push-button switch.  A mezzanine implementation of this signals should not drive it with any voltage, the only allowed operation is to force it to GND to start the board from a sleep mode.
- The Helio X20 Development Board routes the RST_BTN_N (named SYSRSTB on schematic) signal to the SYSRSTB pin of the PMIC MT6351.


### Power Supplies

< Example >

The 96Boards specification calls for three power rails to be present on the Low Speed Expansion Connector:
- +1.8V  Max of 100mA
- +5V  Provide a minimum of 5W of power (1A).

SYS_DCIN  8-18V input with enough current to support all the board functions or the output DCIN from on-board DC Connector able to provide a minimum of 7W of power.

The Helio X20 Development Board supports these requirements as follows:
- +1.8V  Driven by PMIC MT6351 up to  1000mA.  It is the system IO power (VIO18_PMU), and it can supply power up to 200mA to the Low Speed Expansion Connector.
- +5V  Driven by a 6A DC-DC buck converter (U901). It also provides the VBUS power to the two USB host connectors (CON6401, CON6402) and the HDMI 5V power to the HDMI connector (CON6501).The remaining capacity provides a max current of 2A to the Low Speed Expansion Connector, for a total of 10W which meets the 96Boards requirements.

SYS_DCIN  Can serves as the board’s main power source or can receive power from the board.

### Clocks

< Example >

- The 96Boards specification calls for one or two programmable clock interfaces to be provided on the High Speed Expansion Connector. These clocks may have a secondary function of being CSI0_MCLK and CSI1_MCLK. If these clocks can’t be supported by the SoC than an alternative GPIO or No-Connect is allowed by the specifications.
- The Helio X20 Development Board implements two CSI clocks which are connected directly to the MT6797 SoC. These signals are driven at 1.8V.

### USB

< Example >

- The 96Boards specification calls for a USB Data line interface to be present on the High Speed Expansion Connector.

## Power Management Overview

### Block Diagram

< Please provide a block diagram showing how power is routed from various sources to PMIC and then to SoC, expansion connectors, the intermediate regulators >

< Please send any images to robert.wolff@linaro.org >

### DC Power Input

< Additional details and schematics related to power conditioning circuitry to allow hobbyists from power from other sources >

- An 8V to 18V power from a dedicated DC jack J901.
- An 8V to 18V power from the SYS_DCIN pins on the Low Speed Expansion Connector CON7001.

> Note: Please refer to the mechanical size of the DC plug below.The inside diameter of the plug is 1.7mm，the outer diameter of the plug is 4.75mm.The positive electrode of the DC plug is in the inside, and the negative pole is outside.

### Power Source Selection and Sequencing

< Describe any priority mechanism in selection of power source if any and the sequence in which power will be provided to the various components before getting to the SoC. Describe any customisation if possible. A sequence diagram will also be useful to provide >

The user of the Helio X20 Development Board should never apply power to the board from J901 and the Low Speed Expansion connector at the same time. There is no active or passive mechanism on the Helio X20 Development Board to prioritize one source over the other.
